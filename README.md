### Project Description
The Virtual Walkman is a nostalgic, web-based music player inspired by the classic portable cassette players of the 80s üìºüìº. With Spotify integration designed to look and feel like a retro Walkman üéßüíø, users can search for their favorite songs and listen to music previews, all within a fun, retro-themed environment.

### The Problem
Create a retro-inspired virtual Walkman that integrates with Spotify, bringing back the nostalgic experience of cassette players in a digital music streaming era.

### The Solution
This website provides users with a nostalgic interface that resembles a Walkman, complete with interactive cassette reels, playback buttons, and a cassette window showing the current song. Using Spotify's API, users can play their favorite songs or playlists with the aesthetics of a cassette player, bringing back the vintage charm of mixtapes in a digital format. The Virtual Walkman will also allow users to create and share ‚Äúvirtual mixtapes‚Äù with friends, enhancing the personal experience of sharing music.
